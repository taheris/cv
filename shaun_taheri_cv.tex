\section{Skills}

\cvitem{Design}{
  Service-oriented distributed systems architecture from conception to delivery.
}

\cvitem{Languages}{
  Polyglot experience across functional and object-oriented paradigms,
  specialising in Rust for systems programming and the Nix ecosystem for
  deterministic infrastructure.
}

\cvitem{Software}{
  Kubernetes, Nix, Kafka, Postgres, Git, Docker, Emacs, Vim, Linux, macOS.
}

\section{Experience}

\cventry{2016 -- Now}{Senior Developer}{}{Advanced Telematic Systems
  (acquired by HERE)}{Berlin}{
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.25em}
\item
  Built an open-source reference implementation of a secure Software Over The
  Air update client in Rust targeting embedded Linux fleets in the automotive
  industry.
\item
  Infrastructure as Code utilising Nix for configuration management and
  deterministic deployments of a distributed system across cloud and internal
  data-center environments.
\end{itemize}}

\thinspace
\cventry{2014 -- 2016}{Senior Developer}{}{Optiopay}{Berlin}{
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.25em}
\item
  Design and implementation of a microservice architecture with Go services
  using Kafka as an append-only event stream of ProtoBuf messages. Event
  Sourcing was used to build fault-tolerant services that could partition high
  volume workloads.
\item
  Built the continuous delivery operations infrastructure for a pipeline of
  Docker services across a fleet of CoreOS machines using SkyDNS for service
  discovery.
\end{itemize}}

\thinspace
\cventry{2013 -- 2014}{Senior Developer}{}{LShift}{London}{
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Development of a typesetting platform in Python to extract content and
  structure from Google Docs and return template-formatted PDF documents for
  academic publishing.
\item
  Built an internal document crawler in Go using ElasticSearch for distributed
  indexing and rapid searching over a large corpus.
\end{itemize}}

\thinspace
\cventry{2008 -- 2012}{Data $\rightarrow$ Senior Analyst}{}{British Gas}{Edinburgh}{
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.25em}
\item
  Analysis of terabyte-scale datasets using SAS to automate manual billing
  processes with an improvement over the previous system from £4m to £7m per
  annum.
\item
  Built an internal Node.js analytics portal supporting thousands of concurrent
  users, reducing complex report turnaround time from days to minutes.
\end{itemize}}

\section{Education}

\cventry{2012 -- 2013}{MSc Computer Science}{}{University College London}{}{
  Electives in Functional Programming and Information Retrieval. One of the top
  performers of the year with an exam average over 85\%.
}

\cventry{2005 -- 2009}{MA Economics}{}{University of Edinburgh}{}{
